# processing-projects

### Source code for some of my Java [Processing](https://processing.org/) projects


## Additional information

Here's a small selection of my Processing projects, and I plan to continue adding to it over time. I've cleaned up the code for each project. I've added some comments to parts of the code that I thought might need a bit of explanation.

I started making these in late 2018. In the beginning, I drew inspiration from [Dave @beesandbombs](https://beesandbombs.com/) and [Etienne @bleuje](https://bleuje.com/), learning some techniques and approaches.
